# One Pace File Organizer

The **OnePace File Organizer** is a Python script designed to organize OnePace files within a user-specified directory. OnePace is a fan project that recuts the **One Piece** anime to align more closely with the pacing of the original manga by Eiichiro Oda. This tool sorts the files based on their respective saga and arc, according to the structure defined in the [One Piece Wiki](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Story_Arcs).
